/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    The fleet's usual small `diag`: a log file and nothing else. No crash
    handler -- a plugin loaded into Resolume has no business installing a
    process-wide signal handler and intercepting faults that are not its own --
    and no diagnostics bundle, because an effect is a list of sliders in
    somebody else's inspector and there is no UI to hang one off.

    What it covers is the failure that actually happens: `InitGL` returning
    `FF_FAIL` because a shader would not compile. From the operator's side that
    is "the effect does nothing", with no message anywhere. Tilter has six
    shader stages, so the log says *which* one, with the GL vendor and version
    next to it, because that is almost always the reason.
